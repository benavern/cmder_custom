# CMDER CUSTOMISATIONS

This is a set of things I found on the web and that I modified to fit my needs.

| file | description |
|------|-------------|
| theme.lua | theme inspired from the animater theme and personalized by me. the bigger part comes from [cmder-powerline-prompt](https://github.com/AmrEldib/cmder-powerline-prompt). |
|tilde.lua| just use the `~`, and it will be replaced with your home directory path when <kbd>TAB</kbd> is pressed |
